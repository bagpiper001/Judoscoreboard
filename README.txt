This scoreboard is for Team Coolen tournaments optimmized.

Downloading is possible via zip-files. Extract these from your download folder and you'll get a map Judoscoreboard-master.
Inside the Judoscoreboard -> bin - Debug folder you'll find the Judoscoreboard.exe file to test it.


-- Installing during tournaments --
To use this scoreboard during tournaments, it's necessary at the moment to have a laptop at every tatami. 
Note that poulesystem and databases are not yet implemented so a local network or internet access is not required.

This scoreboard does not require any installation and runs only on Windows (it has been tested on Windows 7, 8 and 10 (not mobile) and doesn't work properly on Windows XP).

Running depends on the application you have, there are 2 possibilities:
1. You have a Judoscoreboard.exe file.
2. You have a complete map called JudoscoreboardV2

Before you run the application, make sure you have your monitor attached and running (Press Windows + P to set the screen properties and extend the second monitor).

If you have the Judoscoreboard.exe file, simply double-click it and it will launch.
If you have the folder click Judoscoreboard(Folder) -> bin(Folder) -> Debug (Folder) -> Judoscoreboard.exe and the scoreboard will launch.

On most screens, the scoreboard will automatically detect the second screen and display the main screen and the public screen on the right board.
If it doesn't do that, simply drag and drop the public screen to the correct screen (Public screen is the screen without clickable buttons).
If necessary maximize your screens and you're ready to go.

Please note: I'll update this scoreboard regularly, you can find additions at my Git-project on https://github.com/bagpiper001/Judoscoreboard where you'll also find bugs and new stuff that's
coming up. If you find any bugs feel free to let me know or create an issue yourself.
